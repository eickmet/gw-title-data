Goal is use PRAW(Python Reddit API Wrapper)
to find what are the most common words used in gonewild in the titles that contain the f.
So a title like: "{f}irst time be nice." or what ever would count first as the word.
I wouls really just need to get the titles uses PRAW from the last year or so. Then parse the title looking for 
{} or () or [] to that effect and record the word that they contain. 

So {f}irst incrteaments first
{f}ace increaments face and so on.
